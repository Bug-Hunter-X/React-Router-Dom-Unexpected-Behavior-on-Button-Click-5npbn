# React Router Dom Unexpected Behavior on Button Click

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using React Router Dom v6.  A button click within a component doesn't trigger its intended action consistently, particularly when route transitions are involved.  The issue seems related to how React updates the component state and how React Router handles navigation.

## Bug Description:

The provided `bug.js` file showcases the problem. Clicking the button in the Home component should perform a specific action (which is currently a placeholder). However, under certain conditions (often when navigating between routes or after a rerender), the button click doesn't trigger the expected action, even though it appears to be properly bound.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a fix for this.  It uses the `useRef` hook to ensure that the button's click handler references the most up-to-date component state.  This prevents potential issues where React might be using an outdated reference to the button's state, particularly after re-renders triggered by route changes.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`. 
4. Observe the inconsistent behavior of the button click.
